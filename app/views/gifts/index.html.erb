  <div>
      <p>
        <strong>1.</strong> The maximum gift will be $80 USD or $110 CAD. Going over or under within reason is fine
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2.</strong> No gift cards/cash/online game purchases can be included 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>3.</strong> Gifts must be sent prior to the agreed exchange date
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.</strong> Try not to indicate your name on packages/postages being sent to your recipient
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>5.</strong> No gag gifts or joke gifts, we want this to be fair for all the people involved
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6.</strong> Shipping is not included in the limit, be mindful of that when purchasing any gifts.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>7.</strong> Do not discuss with others who you are matched with unless it is too difficult to buy a gift for that person
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>8.</strong> Once the matches are made, you cannot drop out
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>9.</strong> Do not put down specific gift ideas. You can link websites with stuff you like, not links to specific items
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.</strong> Keep the responses to just gift ideas, nothing obscene or provocative
